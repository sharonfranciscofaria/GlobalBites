I'm excited to share with you to Global Bites, a fictional business website developed using Django Framework as part of Portfolio Project 3. 

![mockup](assets/mockup.jpg)

## Inspiration & Storytelling 

As someone who loves exploring different foods, I wanted to create a business idea that would allow others to experience the same joy and excitement that comes with trying new cuisines.

My inspiration for the rotating menu every three months came from the game Subway Surfers, where they constantly change their themes to keep the game fresh and exciting. I thought that bringing the same concept to Global Bites would make the culinary experience more dynamic and engaging.

I also believe in sustainability and supporting local businesses, which is why I created menus that are environmentally friendly and seasonally based. Using fresh and nutritious ingredients at a fair price not only benefits the environment but also ensures that everyone can enjoy the authentic flavors of different cultures.

# User Experience - UX

## Aim

2. Global Bites' commitment to changing its menu every three months ensures that customers can always expect something new and exciting on their plate, and that they are exposed to a variety of cuisines from different countries throughout the year. The dishes are carefully crafted with attention to detail and inspired by the vibrant and diverse cultures of different regions, from the fragrant spices of the Middle East to the fresh flavors of Southeast Asia.

## Agile Methodology

The development of the Global Bites website was planned using agile methodology which allowed for flexibility in adapting to changing requirements during the development process. Plus the Kanban board helped to visualise the project's progress and prioritise tasks effectively. I was able to break down the project into smaller tasks and work to achieve each milestone.

## Brand & Logo: Canva

![Logo](codersbites/media/testings/brand.png)

![Hikers](codersbites/media/testings/hike-font.PNG)

I chose a handwriting font (Hitch Hike / Antio) for my logo as it gave my brand a unique and personalised touch that stands out from other food businesses. The handwriting font also reflects my brand's personality, which focuses on diverse small plates from around the world, conveying the message that my food is authentic, delicious, and distinct. Using Canva to edit the logo was easy and cost-effective.. Overall, I'm happy with the final result and believe that it helps create a professional brand image.

![antio](codersbites/media/testings/antio-font.PNG)

I decided to go with "Small plates world tour" as I believe it’s a great slogan for a restaurant that serves small plates from around the world. It's catchy, memorable, and suggests that customers can try a variety of international dishes without leaving their seats. The use of the word "world" makes the slogan more inclusive and indicates that the restaurant offers diverse menu options. 

## Colour Palette: Canva

I decided to go for a black and white colour theme for my website because my food pictures are already colourful. It looks clean and sophisticated, making it easy for people to use.

In the future, I might add themed colours that go with my menu for that month. This could make my website look even more exciting and add a sense of anticipation for my customers. Overall, using a black and white colour theme for my website was a good idea, and adding themed colours could make it even better.


## Typography: Google Font / Bootstrap 
![Josefin](codersbites/media/testings/josefin.PNG)
![Poppins](codersbites/media/testings/poppins.PNG)

For Global Bites, I carefully selected fonts that would help communicate the right message to my targeted customers. I chose 'Josefin Sans' for headings because it has a clean, modern, and elegant appearance that aligns well with the restaurant's concept. 'Poppins' was my choice for paragraphs because it's easy to read and complements 'Josefin Sans' nicely.

To maintain consistency and professionalism, I also used 'Josefin Sans' for subheadings. While I opted for these specific fonts in most cases, I also used some fonts provided by Bootstrap for certain elements of my website.

## Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Responsiveness 

![Responsive](codersbites/media/testings/responsive.png)

I used a framework called Bootstrap 4 to create the website. Bootstrap comes with pre-made buttons and forms that are easy to use and saves time. Bootstrap also makes the website fit on different screen sizes, making it easy to use on any device.

To make the website look good without starting from scratch, I used pre-made free components from Bootstrap, MDB, and Bootstrap Brain. Then, I customised these components to fit the branding of the business using CSS.
Using pre-made components helped me save time and made the website look consistent and professional throughout. 


## Database Control Flow

The MVT (Model-View-Template) model is a way of organising code in Django web development. When a user sends a request for a resource, Django searches for that resource and if it finds it, it calls the appropriate view. The view interacts with the model to get the necessary data from the database, and then sends that data to the template, which is responsible for rendering the data in a user-friendly way that can be displayed on the website. Finally, the template is sent back to the user's browser, allowing them to see the requested resource.

![database](codersbites/media/testings/database.webp)


## Code

I built the website using a combination of different programming languages, tools and resources such as HTML, CSS, Python, Django, and Bootstrap. I started by following a youtube video tutorial by Legion Script that provided a step-by-step guide on building a food delivery web application using Django and Python 3.


The tutorial covered different aspects of building the website, including setting up basic pages like the index and about pages, creating an ordering system, implementing PayPal API with AJAX, creating staff login and restaurant dashboard, adding order details, creating a menu page, and adding a search bar.


Using the tutorial as a guide, I built my project by customising and modifying the code to fit the branding and specific needs of the food business. I used Gitpod as my development environment and stored the code on Github.
