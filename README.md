# Global Bites - Introduction
I'm excited to share with you to Global Bites, a fictional business website developed using Django Framework as part of Portfolio Project 3. 


## Inspiration & Storytelling 

As someone who loves exploring different foods, I wanted to create a business idea that would allow others to experience the same joy and excitement that comes with trying new cuisines.

My inspiration for the rotating menu every three months came from the game Subway Surfers, where they constantly change their themes to keep the game fresh and exciting. I thought that bringing the same concept to Global Bites would make the culinary experience more dynamic and engaging.

I also believe in sustainability and supporting local businesses, which is why I created menus that are environmentally friendly and seasonally based. Using fresh and nutritious ingredients at a fair price not only benefits the environment but also ensures that everyone can enjoy the authentic flavors of different cultures.

1. To offer a unique culinary experience to its customers by showcasing the diverse cuisines and cultures of different countries through the art of small plates. The company is passionate about using food as a way to connect people and take them on a journey around the world with each bite.

2. Global Bites' commitment to changing its menu every three months ensures that customers can always expect something new and exciting on their plate, and that they are exposed to a variety of cuisines from different countries throughout the year. The dishes are carefully crafted with attention to detail and inspired by the vibrant and diverse cultures of different regions, from the fragrant spices of the Middle East to the fresh flavors of Southeast Asia.

3. The company's online ordering system provides customers with a convenient way to experience the world of small plates from the comfort of their own home, making it an excellent option for both seasoned foodies and those looking to try something new.

Overall, the website aims to appeal to those who are seeking a unique culinary experience and are open to trying new and diverse flavors.

## Agile Methodology

The development of the Global Bites website was planned using agile methodology which allowed for flexibility in adapting to changing requirements during the development process. Plus the Kanban board helped to visualise the project's progress and prioritise tasks effectively.I was able to break down the project into smaller tasks and work to achieve each milestone.

* To Do- (All the User stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
* In Progress- (then during development story they were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
* Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes)
